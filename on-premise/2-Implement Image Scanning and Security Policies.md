### **1. Trusted Base Images**

-   We should Always start with a base image from a trusted source, such as official repositories or verified registries like Docker Hub or Red Hat Container Catalog.
    
-   We prefer minimal base images like Alpine or Distroless to reduce the attack surface.

		# Use a minimal and trusted base image like Alpine
		FROM alpine:3.18

		# Add only necessary files and packages
		RUN apk add --no-cache python3
		COPY app.py /app/

		CMD ["python3", "/app/app.py"]

##### Note: We may use `FROM scratch` for extremely minimal images if your application doesnâ€™t require a full OS. scratch base images are suitable for *Security-first*  deployments, since there are no unnecessary files, libraries, or tools that could introduce vulnerabilities.

	# Start from scratch
	FROM scratch

	# Set up working directory
	WORKDIR /app

	# Copy Go binary into the image
	COPY ./data-wrangler /app/data-wrangler

	# Specify the application to run
	ENTRYPOINT ["/app/data-wrangler"]

    

### **2. Regularly Scan Images for Vulnerabilities**

-   We use Trivy to identify vulnerabilities in your images. these scan could be integrated in both in CI and/or CD Pipelines
    
-   Integrate vulnerability scanning into your CI/CD pipeline to catch issues early.
    


		stages:
		  - build
		  - scan

		build-job:
		  stage: build
		  script:
		    - docker build -t hd-data-wrangler:latest .

		trivy-scan:
		  stage: scan
		  image: aquasec/trivy:latest
		  variables:
		    DOCKER_HOST: tcp://docker:2376
		    DOCKER_TLS_CERTDIR: "/certs"
		  services:
		    - docker:19.03.12
		  script:
		    # Scan the Docker image and save the output
		    - trivy image --severity HIGH,CRITICAL --format json --output trivy-report.json hd-data-wrangler:latest || export TRIVY_EXIT_CODE=$?
		    # Print results for debugging
		    - cat trivy-report.json
		  allow_failure: true # Allow this job to fail, so the pipeline can proceed

		high-critical-action:
		  stage: notify
		  script:
		    # Perform actions if HIGH or CRITICAL vulnerabilities are found
		    - echo "High/Critical vulnerabilities found! Taking appropriate actions."
		    - # e.g., Notify team via email or Slack
		    - ./scripts/notify-team.sh
		  only:
		    - if: $TRIVY_EXIT_CODE == "1"

		no-issues-action:
		  stage: notify
		  script:
		    # Perform actions if no high/critical vulnerabilities are found
		    - echo "No high/critical vulnerabilities detected. Proceeding with deployment."
		  only:
		    - if: $TRIVY_EXIT_CODE == "0"

-   Enforce Kubernetes **Admission Controllers** (Gatekeeper, Kyverno) to block risky deployments.
Example Kyverno policy (Deny privileged containers):

		apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
		kind: ClusterPolicy
		metadata:
		  name: deny-privileged-containers
		spec:
		  validationFailureAction: Enforce
		  rules:
		  - name: validate-privileged
		    match:
		      resources:
		        kinds:
		        - Pod
		    validate:
		      message: "Privileged mode is not allowed."
		      pattern:
		        spec:
		          containers:
		          - securityContext:
		              privileged: "false"
