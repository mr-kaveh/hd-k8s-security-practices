-   Use **Trivy, Clair, or Aqua Security** to scan for vulnerabilities in images before deployment.
-   Enforce Kubernetes **Admission Controllers** (Gatekeeper, Kyverno) to block risky deployments.
Example Kyverno policy (Deny privileged containers):

		apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
		kind: ClusterPolicy
		metadata:
		  name: deny-privileged-containers
		spec:
		  validationFailureAction: Enforce
		  rules:
		  - name: validate-privileged
		    match:
		      resources:
		        kinds:
		        - Pod
		    validate:
		      message: "Privileged mode is not allowed."
		      pattern:
		        spec:
		          containers:
		          - securityContext:
		              privileged: "false"
