**Enable Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

-   Ensure users have **least privilege** access.
-   Example: Allow only **admins** to deploy applications.

		apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
		kind: Role
		metadata:
		  namespace: production
		  name: developer-role
		rules:
		- apiGroups: [""]
		  resources: ["pods"]
		  verbs: ["get", "list", "create"]

- Integrate with an Identity Provider (OIDC, LDAP, or Active Directory)
